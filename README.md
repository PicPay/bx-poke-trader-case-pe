# Poke Trader

This app allows users to simulate pokemon trades and evaluate if thei are fair or not.

# How to build?

- The front consists of a nodejs React application
- The back consists of a Reails application

# Issues we currently have

1. Our  team is growing, we care about onboarding new team members. Each dev has the freedom to chose their environemnt. This has been causing some issues regarding local shell variables, OS mismatches and infrastructure dependencies.
2. Our application is one of many in our organization. How can we use this one as an example on how others can improve as well?

# Task

- Could you implement something that would solve or reduce the impact of issue 1? Can you share the code with us? Please do not fork this repo.
- Could you plan how could us tackle issue 2? Explain what would you use, how and what do you expect to get from it.
- Considering this application as the baseline for all others in the organization, which other improvements can you suggest to be considered?
